## Firebase Security Rules

For the admin panel to work properly, ensure your Firestore has appropriate security rules. Example rules for admin access:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to sosEvents for admin monitoring
    match /sosEvents/{document} {
      allow read: if true; // Configure based on your admin authentication
    }
    
    // Allow read access to liveLocations for heat map
    match /liveLocations/{document} {
      allow read: if true; // Configure based on your admin authentication
    }
  }
}
```
